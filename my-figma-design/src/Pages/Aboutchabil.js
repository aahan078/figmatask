              Being a parent is for many the ultimate change in life. We
              celebrate the beauty of childhood, in its perfect imperfect way.
              In life <br /> we need to embrace all the ups and downs â€“ they
              will all become part of us, and our memories.
              <br /> Memories come in many diverse ways. Some we would like not
              to think about, and others we love to bring back to life and
              celebrate them.
              <br /> Childhood should be filled with lots of love and great
              memories, and we must always be curious and have dreams for our
              future. <br />

              Creating ChaBil is part of my dream. A dream about creating high
              quality designs and products that embrace life and childhood.
              <br /> For all my life I have embraced the creative aspects, and
              they have been unfolding since my early days. I am born and raised
              in Copenhagen (Denmark) but lived 9 years in New Zealand. At that
              time, I graduated from Christchurch Design School.
              <br /> After my time in New Zealand, I collected lots of
              inspiration from New York, where I lived for more than two years.
              Now we are back in New Zealand, but this time as family. Being a
              mom now gives me the opportunity to use my creativity in a
              different way, and to create unique signature designs and
              versatile products, that hopefully will become a memory of your
              life, or the memory of your little ones.
